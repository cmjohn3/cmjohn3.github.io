## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs
* Lab 4, Part 1
    
  This lab was my first experience working with 2 other partners. The content of the lab was difficult but still understandable and learning how to write each of the conversions into code was challenging. This challenging material made me think hard about the solutions and become very focused on how to put each of the conversions together in the guessing game.

* Lab 7, Part 2
    
  This part of lab 7 had me and my partner trying to code a program that will tell you if you could park at the time and date that you gave. It took several tries and extra meeting to be able to finish this part of the lab. Though I really enjoyed coding it as the dilemma reminded me a lot of math questions with inequalities. My partner and I got stuck often, so it took time a lot of time and brain usage, but completeing each of the locations felt very rewarding.

* Lab 10
  
  This lab was my first exposure to using and understanding 2d vectors. It was also another lab where I completed it with 2 other partners. Even though each of us had very different plans on what we should do to complete both parts of the labs, we negotiated and shared our ideas with each other to get it done in the least problematic way possible. This lab was great for me to grow my cooperation and communication skills in computer science and I really appreciate the experience.
